# Resource-Management-Emu
Emulating incoming requests on an SSD drive via testing algorithms randomly creating objects with different tracks, sectors, and time requests. We store these requests in linked lists. My sorrting algorithms all have different behaviors in regards to their basis of sorting the list of requests. ST_Queue.cpp sorts based on track number and PickUp.cpp queue makes sure to process any requests that come before the next request. More algorithms in development.
